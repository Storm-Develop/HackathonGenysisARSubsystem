"question": "Has the Heineken bottle always looked the same",

"answer": "Although the key elements of the bottle have been in the design for over a century, their details have been refined over the years. Functional improvements, the subtle evolution of the brand and a desire to keep the bottle fresh and up to date are reasons to adjust the design from time to time. Usually, these are very small evolutionary steps to ensure the brand never loses its authenticity and timeless, classic character"

"question": "Why is the Heineken bottle green",

"answer": "Heineken was one of the very first brewers to export bottled beer. The quality was so good that while it was more expensive than local beers, people preferred the premium, imported product. To ensure consumers immediately saw the difference between the regular domestic beers and the premium quality Heineken, the bottle was made green instead of the usual brown. Green was chosen because it radiates freshness, naturalness, purity and premium quality – just like the delicious, cold Heineken beer inside"

{

"faq": {
"question": "How does integrated carbon dioxide cartridge work, exactly?",

"answer": "The pressure system – which includes a small tube with active carbon dioxide – keeps the beer under constant pressure. This relatively small cylinder contains more than enough carbon dioxide to completely empty the keg. It’s also equipped with a control valve that maintains the pressure in the DraughtKeg at approximately 1.0 bar. With consistently good pressure, the beer can be drawn via the beer line attached inside the DraughtKeg. All you have to do is tap and pour cold, fresh, quality Heineken to share with your friends. "

{

"faq": {
"question": "What is the maximum temperature that the DraughtKeg can be exposed to? ",

"answer": "A maximum of 35 degrees Celsius.  If it is exposed to temperatures higher than 35°C, the keg will first begin to swell. If it becomes even warmer, the keg rim around the lid will become loose, which will cause beer or foam to leak from the DraughtKeg.

{
"type": "faq",
"faq": {
"question": "When I try to draw a draught beer from my DraughtKeg, why do I get foam?",

"answer": "This is usually because your DraughtKeg is not cold enough. It must be placed in the refrigerator for at least 10 hours to ensure the temperature of the beer in the keg is around 5°C. Even though the keg usually feels cold to the touch when it’s refrigerated, this is because the metal exterior becomes cold much more quickly – it doesn't always mean that the beer is actually cold enough. For the perfect pour, make sure you open the tap pipe quickly and completely when drawing beer. "
},
"externalUrl": "http://test.co/info/{{$guid}}"
},

{
"type": "faq",
"faq": {
"question": "Why are the first couple of glasses just foam",

"answer": "The first glass can contain more foam because the line in the keg that carries the beer to the top of the keg is filled with carbon dioxide before you tap it. If the beer is cold enough, your second glass should be perfect. If your keg was shaken too much when it was being juggled into position, or while it was on its way to you, let it settle for a while in the fridge to keep it cold. "

"faq": {
"question": "After I draw a beer, why does the beer just keeps flowing in my DraughtKeg. ",

"faq": {
"question": "Does Heineken contain gluten? ",

"answer": "Beer contains gluten, which comes from the grain used to brew it. Only a fraction of the gluten in the grain gets into the beer – the exact amount depends on the kind of grain used. Brewing beer with barley leaves only traces of gluten in the beer, while wheat contributes considerably more. The brewing process can also affect gluten content. Generally speaking, the clearer and blonder the beer is, the less gluten it contains. Some people are allergic to gluten and have to follow a diet that minimises or excludes their gluten intake. Whether beer can be part of such a diet or not depends on the extent of the allergy and the type of beer consumed. In many cases, lager beers pose no problem for people who have a gluten allergy. However, it is up to individuals to assess their own sensitivity."

"question": "What does the red star on the label mean?",

"answer": "The red star is an original icon of the brand, used since the very beginning. Its exact origins are unknown but there are a few possible explanations. For example, some people think it was a symbol of European brewers in the Middle Ages, who believed it to have mystical powers to protect their brew. Another explanation is that four points of the star symbolise the elements earth, fire, water and wind and that the fifth point is the unknown, representing an element that brewers in the Middle Ages couldn’t control. A third explanation is that the position of a star on the front door of the brewery indicated the stage of the brewing process. During the Cold War, the original design was altered to avoid association with communism (it was replaced by a white star with a red outline). After the end of the Cold War, the original full red star was restored. For us, the red star's principle association is a festive, warm and cheerful mood.   "
